I can't stop watching [balenciaga harry](https://twitter.com/blisstweeting/status/1639020116535832577?s=20).  The [artist](https://www.patreon.com/user?u=87233464) has experimented with a workflow of using Midjourney to generate images, and then using additional AI tools to animate mouth movements to voice tracks, which are also generated by AI.  The results are uncanny, but what makes this work so well is that so is high fashion.  I'm hardly an expert, but it seems like the catwalks and outfits and makeup and flashbulbs are all meant to convey something ethereal and beautiful and not quite human.

This juxtaposition of AI art and high fashion sent me down a rabbithole hunting for this wonderful [tweet thread](https://twitter.com/Arr/status/1553482500436946946?s=20) by David Thorpe covering a fictional fashion show in Ljubljana.  The images are haunting and deeply unsettling, but the captions are the real work of art here.
